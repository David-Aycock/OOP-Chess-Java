In order to run the program, double click on RunProgram.bat found in the root directory.
	(The executable JAR is unable to detect the JavaFX components, even though they may be easily located.
	The command in RunProgram.bat simply adds those modules in when executing the .jar file.)

AUTHOR'S NOTE:
There are still a number of components missing, as we were unexpectedly short staffed working on it, with some member(s) disappearing.
More information on what functions are missing and how I would implement them may be found in the final project documentation.
